# Project Progress: Arcade Throwback Collection

## Phase 1: Project Setup - Completed March 31, 2024

### Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project
- Created a Next.js project with TypeScript support
- Verified the project structure and confirmed it builds successfully
- Basic Next.js configuration and default components are in place

### Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS
- Installed Tailwind CSS with associated dependencies (postcss, autoprefixer)
- Created and configured tailwind.config.js
- Updated global styles with Tailwind directives
- Added a test component with Tailwind classes to verify functionality

### Step 3: Install shadcn/ui Dependencies
- Installed required dependencies (class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge)
- Created the components/ui directory structure
- Implemented the Button component from shadcn/ui
- Added utility functions in lib/utils.ts
- Tested the Button component on the home page

### Step 4: Install Phaser 3
- Installed Phaser 3 library
- Created a basic TestScene.ts in scenes directory
- Implemented PhaserGame component for loading Phaser games
- Created a test page (test-game.tsx) to verify Phaser functionality

### Step 5: Set Up Project Structure
- Created directory structure for game scenes (scenes/)
- Created folders for assets (public/sprites/, public/sounds/)
- Set up React components directory (components/)
- Established foundation for modular game development

## Phase 2: Game Menu UI - Completed March 31, 2024

### Step 6: Create GameMenu Component
- Created GameMenu.tsx component with a grid layout for the five games
- Implemented retro-styled UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui buttons
- Added pixel-text class for retro typography
- Each game button triggers a selection function when clicked

### Step 7: Add Game Selection State
- Added state management in index.tsx for tracking the selected game
- Implemented conditional rendering to show either the menu or the selected game
- Added a "Back to Menu" button to return to the game selection screen
- Updated PhaserGame component to accept the selected game as a prop
- Modified TestScene to display the selected game's name

### Step 8: Implement URL-Based Navigation
- Created mappings between game names and URL slugs (e.g., "Whack-a-Mole" â†’ "whack-a-mole")
- Integrated Next.js useRouter to update URL when games are selected
- Added logic to extract game slug from URL on page load
- Created a dynamic [gameSlug].tsx route to handle direct URL access
- Ensured page refresh preserves the selected game via URL

### Additional Steps
- Created a BaseScene class that will be used as the foundation for all game scenes
- Implemented life and level tracking in the BaseScene
- Added methods for managing game state (updateLives, updateLevel, nextLevel, gameOver)

## Phase 3: Game Scene Foundations - Completed April 1, 2024

### Step 9: Create Game Scenes
- Created WhackAMoleScene.ts with full gameplay implementation:
  - Grid of 6 holes with randomly appearing moles
  - Click detection for whacking moles
  - Score tracking and level progression
  - Increasing difficulty based on level (more moles, faster pop-ups, less time)
  
- Created TetrisScene.ts with core tetromino mechanics:
  - 7 different tetromino shapes with distinct colors
  - Rotation, movement, and collision detection
  - Line clearing and scoring system
  - Speed progression based on level
  
- Created SnakeScene.ts with complete implementation:
  - Snake movement and growth mechanics
  - Food spawning system
  - Collision detection (walls, self, obstacles)
  - Obstacles that increase with level and move at higher levels
  
- Created PingPongScene.ts featuring:
  - Player-controlled paddle with smooth movement
  - AI paddle with difficulty scaling by level
  - Ball physics with velocity adjustments
  - Scoring system and win conditions
  
- Created ShootingGameScene.ts with:
  - Player ship controls and shooting mechanics
  - Enemy spawning system
  - Boss levels (3, 7, and 12) with unique attack patterns
  - Health tracking and difficulty progression

### Step 10: Implement Common Patterns Across Games
- Applied consistent UI elements (lives, level, score displays)
- Implemented level progression logic in all games
- Added game over conditions and life management
- Created progressive difficulty scaling in each game
- Set up sound effect placeholders

### Next Steps
- Phase 4: Game Assets and Polish
- Create necessary sprite and sound assets
- Implement game over and level transition UI
- Polish visual elements and gameplay feel
- Test and balance each game's difficulty curve

## Phase 4: Game Assets and Polish - Completed April 2, 2024

### Step 16: Add Game Over and Level Transition
- Created a shadcn/ui Dialog component with retro styling
- Implemented GameDialog component to handle game over and level completion scenarios
- Added callbacks to BaseScene for triggering dialogs from game states
- Updated PhaserGame component to handle dialog events and manage game state
- Implemented retry and next level functionality

### Step 17: Style Menu and Overlays
- Enhanced GameMenu with a more retro 8-bit arcade aesthetic
- Added game icons to each game button for better visual appeal
- Improved the overall UI with consistent styling (borders, colors, fonts)
- Updated the game container with proper borders and dimensions
- Implemented responsive layout for better display across devices

### Step 18: Create Game Assets
- Created SVG sprite assets for all five games:
  - Mole sprite for Whack-a-Mole
  - Tetromino block for Tetris
  - Snake head and food for Snake game
  - Paddle and ball for Ping Pong
  - Ship, enemy, and boss sprites for Shooting Game
- Designed all assets with a consistent pixel art style
- Made all assets scalable SVGs for better performance

### Additional Improvements
- Implemented score tracking in the BaseScene class
- Added UI elements to display scores during gameplay
- Enhanced the game reset functionality to properly handle scores
- Improved the visual feedback for game interactions
- Created a more immersive game experience with consistent styling

### Next Steps
- Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
- Thoroughly test all games across different browsers and devices
- Fix any bugs or issues with gameplay
- Optimize performance and asset loading
- Add sound effects and background music
- Implement local storage for saving high scores

## Sound Implementation - Completed April 2, 2024

### Sound File Setup
- Created directory structure for sound assets
- Added placeholder files for common game sounds (bonk, eat, score, etc.)
- Created documentation for sound file usage and replacement

### Sound Integration
- Updated BaseScene with robust sound loading and error handling
- Implemented a safe sound playback method that prevents runtime errors
- Added sound effects to key game events (scoring, level completion, game over)
- Gracefully handles missing audio files to prevent game crashes

### Future Audio Enhancements
