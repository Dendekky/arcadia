# Project Progress: Arcade Throwback Collection

## Phase 1: Project Setup - Completed March 31, 2024

### Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project
- Created a Next.js project with TypeScript support
- Verified the project structure and confirmed it builds successfully
- Basic Next.js configuration and default components are in place

### Step 2: Install Tailwind CSS
- Installed Tailwind CSS with associated dependencies (postcss, autoprefixer)
- Created and configured tailwind.config.js
- Updated global styles with Tailwind directives
- Added a test component with Tailwind classes to verify functionality

### Step 3: Install shadcn/ui Dependencies
- Installed required dependencies (class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge)
- Created the components/ui directory structure
- Implemented the Button component from shadcn/ui
- Added utility functions in lib/utils.ts
- Tested the Button component on the home page

### Step 4: Install Phaser 3
- Installed Phaser 3 library
- Created a basic TestScene.ts in scenes directory
- Implemented PhaserGame component for loading Phaser games
- Created a test page (test-game.tsx) to verify Phaser functionality

### Step 5: Set Up Project Structure
- Created directory structure for game scenes (scenes/)
- Created folders for assets (public/sprites/, public/sounds/)
- Set up React components directory (components/)
- Established foundation for modular game development

## Phase 2: Game Menu UI - Completed March 31, 2024

### Step 6: Create GameMenu Component
- Created GameMenu.tsx component with a grid layout for the five games
- Implemented retro-styled UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui buttons
- Added pixel-text class for retro typography
- Each game button triggers a selection function when clicked

### Step 7: Add Game Selection State
- Added state management in index.tsx for tracking the selected game
- Implemented conditional rendering to show either the menu or the selected game
- Added a "Back to Menu" button to return to the game selection screen
- Updated PhaserGame component to accept the selected game as a prop
- Modified TestScene to display the selected game's name

### Step 8: Implement URL-Based Navigation
- Created mappings between game names and URL slugs (e.g., "Whack-a-Mole" â†’ "whack-a-mole")
- Integrated Next.js useRouter to update URL when games are selected
- Added logic to extract game slug from URL on page load
- Created a dynamic [gameSlug].tsx route to handle direct URL access
- Ensured page refresh preserves the selected game via URL

### Additional Steps
- Created a BaseScene class that will be used as the foundation for all game scenes
- Implemented life and level tracking in the BaseScene
- Added methods for managing game state (updateLives, updateLevel, nextLevel, gameOver)

## Next Steps
- Phase 3: Game Scene Foundations
- Implement individual game scenes
- Create game assets
